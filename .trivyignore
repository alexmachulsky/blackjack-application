# .trivyignore — Trivy vulnerability suppression list
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This file tells Trivy to ignore specific CVE IDs during image scans.
# The CI pipeline references this file via the `trivyignores:` parameter in
# every `aquasecurity/trivy-action` step.
#
# WHEN TO ADD AN ENTRY:
#   • The CVE is a false positive (vulnerability doesn't apply to this app's
#     usage of the library).
#   • No fix is available yet AND you have a compensating control in place.
#   • The vulnerability is in a dev-only package that is not in the final image.
#
# HOW TO ADD AN ENTRY:
#   Add the CVE ID on its own line, optionally followed by a comment explaining
#   the suppression reason and a review-by date:
#
#   CVE-YYYY-XXXXX  # Reason: <why suppressed> | Review by: YYYY-MM-DD
#
# EXAMPLES (do not uncomment — these are illustrative only):
#
#   CVE-2023-12345  # FP: only affects Windows builds | Review by: 2025-06-01
#   CVE-2024-99999  # No fix available; runtime not exposed to untrusted input
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# IMPORTANT: Every suppressed CVE MUST have a comment.  Uncommented CVE IDs
# should be rejected in code review — silent suppressions are a security risk.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Currently suppressed: none.
# All CRITICAL CVEs in backend and frontend images are clean as of the last
# scan run.  Run `trivy image <image>:<tag>` locally to re-check at any time.
